      <p>Pure Sheabutter</p>

      <h3>
        Shea butter is a fat extracted from the nut of the African
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitellaria" target="_blank">
          shea tree.</a
        >
        The shea tree is a traditional African food plant. It has been claimed
        to have potential to improve nutrition. The Karite tree bears the
        fruits, and the nuts inside the fruits are of prime importance. These
        nuts are crushed, boiled, and manipulated to extract a light-colored
        fat, which is commonly referred to as shea butter. The main components
        of shea butter include oleic acid, stearic acid, linoleic acid, etc. It
        gets absorbed quickly into the skin as it melts at body temperature. Its
        moisturizing and healing properties prove beneficial for many skin
        issues. It also has anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties (to a
        certain extent) that can be utilized to treat many ailments. Its
        similarity to many vegetable oils makes it suitable for ingestion
